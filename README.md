# [Advanced GIS Portfolio](https://aej6qm.github.io/Advanced-GIS/)
Welcome to my public portfolio for Advanced GIS at Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2022. This portfolio will contain GIS-related visualizations that I created over the course of the class. For more information about the maps shown here, please contact me at aejensen@andrew.cmu.edu. Thanks for visiting!

## About me
Hi! My name is Anne (she/her) and I'm a second-year graduate student at CMU studying public policy and management. My areas of interest include social and environmental policy, especially at the intersection of race and environmental justice. 

Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, I received my BA in American Studies and Sociology from the University of Virginia. I have some campaign experience, and spent a year working as an AmeriCorps VISTA in the Greater Pittsburgh area. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, and playing with my Sheltie puppy, Buddy.

## What I hope to learn
I'm excited to come away from this class having acquired the skills and tools necessary to simplify complicated data sets and convey a narrative using that data. I really enjoyed the introduction to ArcGIS I received last semester, but since not every organization has accesss to Esri tools it's useful to be able to create maps using a wide variety of platforms.

After graduation, I plan to work as a analytics consultant where I will continue to convey complex narratives using easy to understand visualizations.
