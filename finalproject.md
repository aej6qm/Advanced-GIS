# Final Project

This project uses a suite of ArcGIS products to visualize and analyze Pittsburgh's post-pandemic recovery by neighborhood and in comparison to other similarly sized metro areas. Part I materials are contained in a Google Drive folder, while the final deliverable can be found on ArcGIS Storymaps. 

## [Part I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qV2nMlPmVOnPWXMzR6cdspe8raFzQQvWcq2xGfm9Vk/edit?usp=sharing)

The initial documentation for Part I includes a hypothetical bid for a theoretical client (in this case Allegheny County Economic Development), a basic work plan, and cost-estimates for the expected work and hardware.

## [Part II](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tg96GSlRw_Z8ZzxBD3FRuDIBWLiyqEwV7pD2lOTNmmI/edit?usp=sharing)
